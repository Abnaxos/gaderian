/**
 * Service interface for <code>gaderian.utilitiesChainBuilder</code>, a service which can assemble an
 * implementation based on a command interface, and an ordered list of objects implementing that
 * interface (the "commands"). This is an implementation of the Gang of Four Chain Of Command
 * pattern.
 * <p>
 * For each method in the interface, the chain implementation will call the corresponding method on
 * each command object in turn. If any of the command objects return true, then the chain of command
 * stops and the initial method invocation returns true. Otherwise, the chain of command continues
 * to the next command (and will return false if none of the commands returns true).
 * <p>
 * For methods whose return type is not boolean, the chain stops with the first non-null (for object
 * types), or non-zero (for numeric types). The chain returns the value that was returned by the
 * command. The chain If the method return type is void, all command will be invoked.
 * <p>
 * Method invocations will also be terminated if an exception is thrown.

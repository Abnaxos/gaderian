       <section name="Service Models Configuration">
      <p>The <a href="module-report/config/gaderian.ServiceModels.html">
			ServiceModels</a> configuration defines the available service models.
			Service models control the lifecycle of services: when they are created
			and when they are destroyed (often tied to the current thread's activity).</p>

      <p>The contribution format defines the name and class for each service
			model:</p>

      <source>
&lt;service-model name="..." class="..."/&gt; </source>
		<p>An instance of the specified class will be instantiated. The class must
			implement the <a href="apidocs/org/ops4j/gaderian/internal/ServiceModelFactory.html">
			ServiceModelFactory</a> interface (which creates an instance of the
			actual service model for a particular service extension point).</p>
		<p>Names of service models must be unique; it is not possible to override
			the built-in service model factories.</p>

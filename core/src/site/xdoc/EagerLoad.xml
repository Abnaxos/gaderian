      <p>The <a href="module-report/config/gaderian.EagerLoad.html">EagerLoad</a>
			configuration allows services to be constructed when the Registry is first
			initialized. Normally, Gaderian goes to great lengths to ensure that
			services are only constructed when they are first needed. Eager loading is
			appropriate during development (to ensure that services are configured
			properly), and some services that are event driven may need to be
			instantiated early, so that they may begin receiving event notifications
			even before their first service method is invoked.</p>

      <p>Care should be taken when using services with the pooled or threaded
			service models to invoke cleanup the thread immediately after creating the
			Registry.</p>

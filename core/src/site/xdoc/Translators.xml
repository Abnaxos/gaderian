      <p>The <a href="module-report/config/gaderian.Translators.html">Translators</a>
			configuration defines the translators that may be used with XML conversion
			rules.</p>

      <p>Contributions are of the form:</p>

      <source>
&lt;translator name="..." class="..." service-id="..."/&gt; </source>
		<p>Only one of <code>class</code> and <code>service-id</code> attributes should be
			specified. The former is the complete name of a class (implementing the
			<a href="apidocs/org/ops4j/gaderian/schema/Translator.html">Translator</a> interface). It
			should have a no-args and/or single String constructor.	The second is used to
			contribute a service (which must also implement the interface).</p>
		<p>Names of translators must be unique; it is not possible to override the
			existing service model translators. A single translator, <code>class</code>,
			is hard-coded into Gaderian, the others appear as ordinary contributions.</p>

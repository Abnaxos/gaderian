            <p>Converts a classpath into a space-separated list of items used to set the
                <code>Manifest Class-Path</code>
                attribute.
            </p>
            <p>This is highly useful when modules are packaged together inside an
                Enterprise Application Archive (EAR). Library modules may be deployed
                inside an EAR, but (in the current J2EE specs), there's no way for such
                modules to be added to the classpath in the deployment descriptor;
                instead, each JAR is expected to have a Manifest Class-Path attribute
                identifying the exactly list of JARs that should be in the classpath. This
                Task is used to generate that list.
            </p>
            <p>This task is implemented as<a href="ant/ManifestClassPath.html">
                org.ops4j.gaderian.ant.ManifestClassPath</a>.

/**
 * Lifecycle interface that may be implemented by objects
 * that need to know when the {@link org.ops4j.gaderian.Registry}
 * has shutdown.  Typically, this is implemented by core service implementations
 * (as well as many proxies created by Gaderian).
 *
 * <p>
 * A core service implementation that implements this interface will
 * automatically be registered for notifications (exception: not if the service
 * uses the threaded service model).
 *
 * <p>Using this notification is
 * preferrable to implementing a <code>finalize()</code> since it will be invoked
 * at a known time.
 *
 * <p>
 * The order in which listeners will be invoked is
 * not well known. In the future, some form of dependency system may
 * be instituted.

/**
 * An object which is used to resolve classes and class-path resources. This is needed because, in
 * an application server, different class loaders may be involved in loading different Gaderian
 * modules. For example, the Gaderian library may be on the system claasspath, and modules may
 * include EJBs and WARs, each loaded by a different classloader.
 * <p>
 * The class loader for the framework needs to be able to see resources in the application, but the
 * application's class loader is a descendent of the framework's class loader. To resolve this, we
 * need a 'hook', an instance that provides access to the application's class loader.

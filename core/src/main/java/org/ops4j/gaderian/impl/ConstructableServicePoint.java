     * <p>
     * Note that the order is tricky! To keep any error messages while ordering the interceptors
     * understandable, they are ordered according into runtime execution order. Example: If we want
     * a logging interceptor to operate before a security-check interceptor, we'll write the
     * following in the descriptor:
     *
     * <pre>
     *               &lt;interceptor service-id=&quot;gaderian.LoggingInterceptor&quot; before=&quot;*&quot;/&gt;

     * The <code>before</code> value for the first interceptor contribution will be assigned to
     * the contribution's
     * {@link org.ops4j.gaderian.internal.ServiceInterceptorContribution#getFollowingInterceptorIds() followingInterceptorIds}
     * property, because all other interceptors (including the security interceptor) should have
     * their behavior follow the logging interceptor.
     * <p>
     * To get this behavior, the logging interceptor will delegate to the security interceptor, and
     * the security interceptor will delegate to the core service implementation.
     * <p>
     * The trick is that interceptors are applied in reverse order: we start with core service
     * implementation, wrap it with the security interceptor, then wrap that with the logging
     * interceptor ... but that's an issue that applies when building the interceptor stack around
     * the core service implementation.

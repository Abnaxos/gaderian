/**
 * Implementation of {@link org.ops4j.gaderian.ServiceImplementationFactory} that can instantiate
 * an object and then configure its properties.
 * <p>
 * Some thought has been given to using bytecode generation to create properties for messages,
 * extension point id, and so forth. This is being avoided because it undermines the ability to test
 * service implemenations as POJOs, outside the framework of Gaderian.
 * <p>
 * Instead the service is configured by means of the implementation's constructor and setter
 * methods.

/**
 * Object which can translate a string into an object value.  This is used to
 * translate attribute values (or element content) from strings into
 * numbers, booleans or other constructs before assigning the final value
 * to a propery.  Translation occurs after symbol substitution.
 * 
 * <p>
 * Translator classes should have a public constructor that takes no
 * arguments.  They may optionally have a second constructor
 * that takes a single string as a parameter.  When the
 * {@link org.ops4j.gaderian.parse.DescriptorParser} encounters
 * a <code>translator</code> of the form 
 * "<code><i>translator-id</i>,<i>initialization-string</i></code>"
 * (example: "int,min=0") it will use the second constructor, passing
 * the initialization string.
 * 
 * <p>
 * Generally, initializion strings are of the form
 * <code><i>key</i>=<i>value</i>[,<i>key</i>=<i>value</i>]*</code>.
 * Each initializer has a set of keys it recognizes, other keys are simply
 * ignored.

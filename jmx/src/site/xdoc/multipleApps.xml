  	<p>
  		If you want to run multiple Gaderian applications which
  		use JMX in a single JVM or application server, then there is
  		a chance of getting naming collisions.
  	</p>
  	<p>
  		By default Gaderian prepends "gaderian:" as domain name to
  		the names of all MBeans. For example the service
  		"test.management.Calculator" gets registered using the
  		ObjectName "gaderian:module=test.management,type=service,id=Calculator".
		</p>
		<p>
  		If multiple applications export the same service you
  		should must choose unique domain names for each application.
  		The domain name is configured as ApplicationSymbol:

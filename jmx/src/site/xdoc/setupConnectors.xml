      <section name="Setup JMX Connectors">
  	<p>
  		Finally you have to decide how you want to access the management
  		functionality of your application. The JMX specification calls
  		the responsible components connectors and protocol adaptors.
  		The HTML protocol adaptors have the big advantage, that no
  		additional management console is needed. All that is needed is
  		a web browser.<br/>
  		Gaderian offers preconfigured services for the most common
  		connectors.
  	</p>
		<subsection name="HTML Adaptors">

            <p>HTML Adaptors are provide by MX4J and Sun RI.
			</p>
			<h4>MX4J HTML Adaptor</h4>
				<p>Enable the MX4J HTML Adaptor by including these lines in
					your descriptor:
				</p>
				<source><![CDATA[
<contribution configuration-id="gaderian.management.MBeans">
   <mbean service-id="gaderian.management.connector.MX4JHttpAdaptorMBean"
          start-method="start" />
</contribution>]]></source>
				<p>By default the adaptor listens on port 9000 for incoming
					HTTP request and renders a HTML user interface.<br/>
					To change the port, modify the symbol "management.http.Port":
				</p>
				<source><![CDATA[
<contribution configuration-id="gaderian.ApplicationDefaults">
  <default symbol="management.http.Port" value="9001" />
</contribution>]]></source>

			<h4>SUN RI HTML Adaptor</h4>
				<p>Enable the SUN HTML Adaptor by including these lines in
					your descriptor:
				</p>
				<source><![CDATA[
<contribution configuration-id="gaderian.management.MBeans">
   <mbean service-id="gaderian.management.connector.SunHttpAdaptorMBean"
          start-method="start" />
</contribution>]]></source>
				<p>The default port and configuration of the port correspond
					to the MX4J description above.
				</p>
			<h4>J2SE 1.5 and HTML Adaptors</h4>
				<p>There is no HTTP Adaptor provided with J2SE 1.5.
					But you can combine the MX4J or Sun RI HTTP Adaptors with
					J2SE 1.5. Just include the xxx-tools.jar in the classpath
					and setup the adaptor like described above.
				</p>
		</subsection>
		<subsection name="JSR 160 connectors">
			<p>JSR 160 connectors allow the remote management of the application using any
				management console that supports that standard (like JConsole, MC4J).
				The connectors are created by a standardized api so there are no implementation
				specific MBeans like with HTTP Adaptors. <br/>
				The standard allows use of different protocols for the remote management (which
				must be supported by both the JMX implementation and the management console).
				Most common is a RMI protocol and this is what Gaderian uses by default.
				The protocol requires a running RMI Registry. <br/>
				Add these lines:
			</p>
				<source><![CDATA[
<contribution configuration-id="gaderian.management.MBeans">
   <mbean service-id="gaderian.management.connector.NamingServiceMBean"
      start-method="start" />
   <mbean service-id="gaderian.management.connector.JMXConnectorServerMBean"
      start-method="start" />
</contribution>]]></source>
				<p>Now you can connect to the application with jconsole or MC4J
					using this url: service:jmx:rmi://localhost/jndi/rmi://localhost:1099/jmx .
				</p>
				<p>You can change RMI port and the service url this way:
				</p>
				<source><![CDATA[
<contribution configuration-id="gaderian.ApplicationDefaults">
  <default symbol="management.namingservice.port" value="1099" />
  <default symbol="management.jmxconnector.ServiceUrl"
      value="service:jmx:rmi://localhost/jndi/rmi://localhost:1099/jmx" />
</contribution>]]></source>
		</subsection>
		<subsection name="J2SE 1.5 local connector">
			<p>Local management with jconsole is possible without adding any connector, if
				your application runs on J2SE 1.5. Simply set the
				system property com.sun.management.jmxremote before launching your app:
			</p>
				<source><![CDATA[
java -Dcom.sun.management.jmxremote ...]]></source>

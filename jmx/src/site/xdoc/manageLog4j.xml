      <section name="Manage Log4J loggers via JMX">
  	<p>Gaderian JMX includes support for the management of Log4J.
  		Gaderian uses the basic MBeans already provided by Log4J
  		and adds configurable and dynamic registration of new loggers
  		for management.
  		The MBeans can be used to change log levels, add new
  		appenders and set log thresholds.
		</p>
		<p>
  		Add these lines to your descriptor to activate the
  		Log4j management and create MBeans for all loggers named
  		"gaderian.*" (* is a wildcard ).

          <div class="content">At startup Gaderian searches for known loggers that match the
              configured name patterns. It's quite likeley, that some
              of the loggers that should be managed doesn't exist in this
              early phase, since usually loggers are create when a class gets loaded.
              If loggers are missing try to add them using the addLoggerMBean
              method of the LogManagementMBean on runtime.

	<p>
	The Gaderian JMX library brings the benefits of mature application management
	and monitoring to your Gaderian based applications by integration of
	the
	<a target="_blank" href="http://java.sun.com/products/JavaManagement">Java Management Extension (JMX)</a>.
	</p>
	<p>With minimal effort you can reach these goals, for example:
    	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Change log levels in your running application via a web based interface
			or by use of a management console</li>
		<li>Measure the performance of middleware calls and view the data online</li>
		<li>Make your services configurable at runtime. Change database urls or cache sizes</li>
	</ul>

	<p>
		The services of this library are implemented in the module
	<a href="module-report/module/gaderian.management.html">gaderian.management</a>
	</p>
	<p>Start <a href="quickstart.html">here</a> for a JMX quickstart or read
		a more detailled introduction <a href="setupOverview.html">here</a>

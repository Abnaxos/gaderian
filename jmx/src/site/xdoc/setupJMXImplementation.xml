      <section name="Choose JMX implementation">
  	<p>First of all you have to choose how all the JMX infrastructure
  		is provided. Various JMX implementations are freely available.</p>
  	<p>Gaderian uses <a target="_blank" href="http://mx4j.sourceforge.net" >MX4J</a>
			for development and testing, but it can run with any other JMX 1.2
			implementation. Gaderian has additionally been tested with
			J2SE 1.5 and the Sun Reference Implementation of JMX.
		</p>
		<subsection name="MX4J">
			<p>Get MX4J <a target="_blank" href="http://mx4j.sourceforge.net" >here</a>
				in version 2.x or grab the libraries from the ext-package/lib
				folder after an ant build of Gaderian</p>
			<p>Add mx4j.jar, mx4j-tools.jar to the classpath. Add mx4j-remote.jar only if you use JSR 160 connectors.
			</p>
		</subsection>
		<subsection name="J2SE 1.5">
			<p>If your application runs with Sun J2SE 1.5 no additional libraries are needed
				This can change later if you decide to use HTTP to manage your application.
			</p>
		</subsection>
		<subsection name="Sun Reference Implementation">
			<p>The Sun RI can be downloaded <a target="_blank" href="http://java.sun.com/products/JavaManagement/download.html">here</a>
				in version 1.2.1
			</p>
			<p>Add jmxri.jar and jmxtools.jar to the classpath.

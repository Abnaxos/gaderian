		<title>Gaderian Localization</title>
	</properties>
	<body>
		<section name="localization">
		<p>Every Gaderian module may have its own set of messages. Messages are
			stored alongside the module deployment descriptor, as <code>
			META-INF/org/ops4j/gaderian/module.properties</code> (within the module's JAR).</p>
		<div class="frame note"><div class="label">Note</div><div class="content">In actuality, the name of the properties file is created by stripping
			off the extension (".xml") from the descriptor name and
			appending the localization code and ".properties". This is relevant only
			if you load your module deployment descriptors from a non-standard
			location, possibly via the <a href="descriptor.html#sub-module">&lt;sub-module&gt;</a> element.</div></div>
		<p>Services can gain access to localized messages, as an instance of <a href="gaderian/apidocs/org/ops4j/gaderian/Messages.html">Messages</a>
			, which includes methods for accessing messages and formatting messages
			with arguments.</p>
		<p>In a module descriptor, within the <a href="descriptor.html#contribution">&lt;contribution&gt;</a> and <a href="descriptor.html#invoke-factory">&lt;invoke-factory&gt;</a>
			elements, you can reference a localized message in an attribute or element
			content simply by prefixing the message key with '%'. Examples:</p>
		<source> <![CDATA[
<contribution configuration-id=...>
  <some-item> <message="%message.key">
    %other.message.key
  </some-item>
</contribution>]]> </source>
		<p>The two keys (<code>message.key</code> and <code>other.message.key</code>
			) are searched for in the <em>contributing</em> module's messages.</p>

        <div class="frame warning">
            <div class="label">Warning</div>
            <div class="content">
                Support for this '%' syntax will likely be removed soon. This is because
                the locale is now changeable; what locale to use when converting configuration
                data becomes dangerously ambiguous.
            </div>
        </div>

		<p>Gaderian gracefully recovers from undefined messages. If a message is not
			in the properties file, then Gaderian provides a substitute value by
			converting the key to upper-case and adding brackets, i.e. <code>
			[MESSAGE.KEY]</code>. This allows your application to continue running,
			but clearly identifies missing messages.</p>
		<p>By adding additional files, message localization can be accomplished. For
			example, adding a second file, <code>META-INF/org/ops4j/gaderian/module_fr.properties</code>
			would provide French language localizations. Any common keys between the
			two files defer to the more specific file.</p>

      <p>
        The <a href="gaderian/BuilderFactory.html">gaderian.BuilderFactory</a> can inject an <a href="gaderian/apidocs/org/ops4j/gaderian/Messages.html">Messages</a> object that allows access
        to the module's messages.
      </p>
      </section>
		<section name="Setting the locale">
			<p>When a <a href="gaderian/apidocs/org/ops4j/gaderian/Registry.html">Registry</a> is created by the <a href="gaderian/apidocs/org/ops4j/gaderian/impl/RegistryBuilder.html">RegistryBuilder</a>, a locale
				is specified. This is the <em>default</em> locale for the Registry and, by extension, for
				all Modules in the registry. </p>

        <p>
          Threads will always use this locale by default, but the locale for
          an individual <em>thread</em> may be changed using the <a href="gaderian/ThreadLocale.html">gaderian.ThreadLocale</a> service.
          The <a href="gaderian/apidocs/org/ops4j/gaderian/Messages.html">Messages</a> injected into your services automatically adjusts for the
          thread's current locale.
        </p>

        <p>
          You should not store, in your services, any localized values, since different threads
          may want different localizations. Instead, you should always obtain values
          from the <a href="gaderian/apidocs/org/ops4j/gaderian/Messages.html">Messages</a>.

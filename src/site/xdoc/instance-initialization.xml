      <section name="Lightweight Instance Initialization">
    <p> There are frequently situations in which you want Gaderian to create an instance of an object for you, and initialize some of its properties. </p>
    <p> The <a href="gaderian/BuilderFactory.html">gaderian.BuilderFactory</a> can do this ... but it means dressing up your instance as a complete service, which can be cumbersome and overkill. </p>
    <p> In Gaderian 1.0, you didn't have many other options. Starting with Gaderian 1.1, you do: <em>lightweight instance initialization</em>. </p>
    <p> In certain places where you specify a class name (<a href="descriptor.html#create-instance">&lt;create-instance&gt;</a>, <a href="rules.html#create-object">&lt;create-object&gt;</a>, the <a href="rules.html#instance">instance translator</a> and the <a href="gaderian/ObjectProviders.html">instance object provider</a>), you can further identify a list of properties and values. The values are always strings and are converted to appropriate types for assignment. </p>
    <p> The class name is seperated from the property values by a comma, and a comma seperates each property value pair. An equals sign seperates each property from its value. The end result is quite readable: <code>com.example.MyBean,name=Bean,priority=10</code>. </p>
    <p> For properties that are boolean, you can omit the equals sign and value. The value 'true' is assumed. Example: </p>
          <code>com.example.MyBean,required</code>
          <p>would set the required property of the bean to true. </p>
    <p> Alternately, you can prefix the boolean property name with an exclamation point to set the value to false. Example: <code>com.example.MyBean,!required</code> </p>
    <p> These object instantiations and initializations occur within a reference module; you can omit the module's package from the class name. </p>

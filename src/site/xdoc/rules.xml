        <section name="Contribution Processing Rules">
		<p>The concept of performing a rules-directed conversion of elements and
			attributes into Java objects was pioneered (to my knowledge) in the <a
			href="http://jakarta.apache.org/commons/digester/">Jakarta Digester</a>
			framework (which started inside Tomcat, moved to Struts, and is now
			available on its own).</p>
		<p>The technique is very powerful, even in the limited subset of Digester
			provided by Gaderian (over time, the number of available rules will
			increase).</p>
        </section>
		<section name="Rules">
			<p>Rules are attached to <a href="descriptor.html#element">&lt;element&gt;</a>s. Each rule object has two methods: the
				<a
				href="gaderian/apidocs/org/ops4j/gaderian/schema/Rule.html#begin(org.ops4j.gaderian.schema.SchemaProcessor, org.ops4j.gaderian.Element)"
				>begin()</a> method is invoked when the element is first encountered.
				The content of the element is then processed recursively (which will
				involve more rules). Once that completes, the <a
				href="gaderian/apidocs/org/ops4j/gaderian/schema/Rule.html#end(org.ops4j.gaderian.schema.SchemaProcessor, org.ops4j.gaderian.Element)"
				>end()</a> method is invoked.</p>
			<p>Note: <code>begin()</code> is invoked in the order that rules are
				defined within the <a href="descriptor.html#rules">&lt;rules&gt;</a> element. <code>end()</code> is invoked in
				inverse order. This rarely makes any difference.</p>
			<p>Element processing is based on an object stack. Several rules will
				manipulate the top object on the stack, setting properties based on
				attributes or content. The <a href="rules.html#create-object">&lt;create-object&gt;</a> rule will instantiate a new
				object at <code>begin()</code> and pop it off the stack at <code>end()</code>
				.</p>
			<p>In several cases, rule descriptions reference the parent and child
				objects. The top object on the stack is the child, the object beneath
				that is the parent. The <a href="rules.html#set-parent">&lt;set-parent&gt;</a> and <a href="rules.html#invoke-parent">&lt;invoke-parent&gt;</a> rules are
				useful for creating hierarchies of objects.</p>
			<section name="create-object">
				<p>The &lt;create-object&gt; rule is used to create a new object, which is
					pushed onto the stack at <code>begin()</code>. The object is popped
					off the stack at <code>end()</code>. &lt;create-object&gt; is typically
					paired up with &lt;invoke-parent&gt; to connect the new object (as a child)
					to a parent object.</p>

    <section name="Translators">
      <p>Commonly, it is necessary to perform some translation or transformation of string attribute value to convert
        the value into some other type, such as boolean, integer or date. This can be accomplished by specifying a
        translator in the <a href="descriptor.html#attribute">&lt;attribute&gt;</a> element (it also applies to element content, with the
        <code>content-translator</code> attribute of the <a href="descriptor.html#element">&lt;element&gt;</a> element).</p>
      <p>A translator is an object implementing the <a href="gaderian/apidocs/org/ops4j/gaderian/schema/Translator.html">Translator</a> interface. The <code>translator</code> value
        specified in a rule may be either the complete class name of a class implementing the interface, or one of a
        number of builtin values.</p>
      <p>Translators configurations consist of a translator name, and an optional initalizer string. The initializer
        string is separated from the translator id by a comma, ex: <code>int,min=0</code> (where <code>min=0</code> is
        the initializer string). Initializer strings are generally in the format of <code>key=value[,key=value]*</code>
        ... but each Translator is free to interpret the initializer string its own way.</p>
      <p>The following sections describe the basic translators provided with the framework. You can add additional
        translators by contributing to the <a href="gaderian/Translators.html">gaderian.Translators</a> configuration point.</p>
      <section name="boolean">
        <p>The boolean translator converts an input string into a boolean value. "true" is translated to true, and
          "false" to false.</p>
        <p>A default value is used when the input is blank. Normally, this default is false, but the "default" key in
          the initializer can override this (i.e., <code>boolean,default=true</code>).</p>
      </section>
      <section name="class">
        <p>The class translator converts a class name into a Class object. The value must
        be a fully qualified class name. A null input value returns null.</p>
        <div class="frame note"><div class="label">Note</div><div class="content">This translator is hard-coded, and does not appear in the
          <a href="gaderian/Translators.html">gaderian.Translators</a>
          configuration point.
        </div></div>
      </section>
      <section name="configuration">
        <p>The configuration translator converts an input value into a configuration point id, then obtains the
          elements for that configuration point as a List. The id may be fully qualified, or a local id within the
          contributing module.</p>
        <p>A blank input value returns null.</p>
      </section>
      <section name="double">
        <p>The double translator converts the input into an double precision floating point value. It recognizes three
          initializer values:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>default: the default value (normally 0) to use when the input is blank</li>
          <li>min: a minimum acceptible value</li>
          <li>max: a maximum acceptible value</li>
        </ul>
      </section>
      <section name="enumeration">
        <p>The enumeration translator converts input strings into enumerated values. Enumeration <em>requires</em> an
          initializer string, with a special format: <br/> <code>
          enumeration,class-name,input=field-name[,input=field-name]*</code> </p>
        <p>That is, the initializer begins with the name of the class containing some number of public static fields.
          Input values are mapped against field names. Example: <br/> <code>
          enumeration,java.lang.Boolean,yes=TRUE,no=FALSE</code> </p>
        <p>If the input is null or empty, then the translator returns null.</p>
        <p>The class name for the enumeration may be abbreviated.</p>
      </section>
      <section name="id-list">
        <p>Translates a comma-seperated list of ids into a comma-seperated list of fully qualified ids (qualified
          against the contributing module). Alternately, passes the value <code>*</code> through as-is. Id lists are
          typically used to establish ordering of items within a list, as with <a href="descriptor.html#interceptor">&lt;interceptor&gt;</a>. </p>
      </section>
      <section name="instance">
        <p>The object translator converts a fully qualified class name into an object instance. The class must
          implement a public no-arguments constructor.</p>
          <p>The class name may be abbreviated.</p>

         <p>
          The instance translator may also initialize properties  using <a href="instance-initialization">instance initializer</a> syntax.
          </p>
      </section>
      <section name="int">
        <p>The int translator converts the input into an integer value. It recognizes three initializer values:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>default: the default value (normally 0) to use when the input is blank</li>
          <li>min: a minimum acceptible value</li>

        </div></div>
      </section>
      <section name="long">
        <p>The long translator converts the input into an long integer (64 bit) value. It recognizes three initializer
          values:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>default: the default value (normally 0) to use when the input is blank</li>
          <li>min: a minimum acceptible value</li>
          <li>max: a maximum acceptible value</li>
        </ul>
      </section>
      <section name="object">
        <p>
          The object translator is allows the caller to provide an object value
          in a multitude of ways. The object translator inverts the normal roles; the caller
          has all the power in determining how to interpret the value, and the schema
          takes whatever value shows up.
          The object translator is driven by the
          <a href="gaderian/ObjectProviders.html">gaderian.ObjectProviders</a> configuration.
        </p>
        <p>
          Some object providers include a class name, which may be abbreviated and will be
          resolved by the <em>contributing</em> module.

        <p>Translates an id into a fully qualified id (qualified against the contributing module's id). </p>
      </section>
      <section name="resource">
        <p>The resource translator is used to find a resource packaged with (or near) the module's deployment
          descriptor. The input value is the relative path to a file. The translator converts the input value to a
          <a href="gaderian/apidocs/org/ops4j/gaderian/Resource.html">Resource</a> for that file.</p>
        <p>If the file doesn't exist, then an error is logged. If a localization of the file exists, then the Resource
          for that localization is returned.</p>
      </section>
      <section name="service">
        <p>The service translator is used to lookup a service in the registry. The input
        value is either a local service id from the contributing module, or a fully qualified service id.</p>
        <div class="frame note"><div class="label">Note</div><div class="content">This translator is hard-coded, and does not appear in the

        <p>The service translator is used to lookup a service point (not a service) in the registry. The input value is
          either a local service id from the contributing module, or a fully qualified service id.</p>
      </section>
      <section name="smart">
        <p>The smart translator attempts an automatic conversion from a string value (the
        attribute value or element content) to a particular type. It determines the type from the property to which the
        value will be assigned. Smart translator makes use of the JavaBeans's PropertyEditor class for the conversion,
        which allows easy this translator to be used with most common primitive types, such as int, short and boolean.
        See the <a href="gaderian/apidocs/org/ops4j/gaderian/schema/rules/SmartTranslator.html"> SmartTranslator</a> documentation for more
        details.</p> <p>In general, the smart translator is the useful for most ordinary Java type properties, unless
        you want to specify range constraints.</p> <p>It recognizes one initializer value:</p> <ul> <li>default: the
        default value to use when the input is blank</li> </ul>

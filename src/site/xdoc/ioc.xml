        <section name="Inversion of Control">
		<p>Seems like <a href="http://excalibur.apache.org/framework/guide-patterns-ioc.html"><strong>
			Inversion of Control</strong></a> is all the rage these days. The <a
			href="http://excalibur.apache.org/">Apache Excalibur</a> project is completely based
			around it. Excalibur uses detailed assembly descriptions to tie services
			together ... there's no way an Excalibur component can "look up" another
			component; in Excalibur you explicitly connect services together.</p>
		<p>That's the basic concept of Inversion of Control; you don't create your
			objects, you describe how they should be created. You don't directly
			connect your components and services together in code, you describe which
			services are needed by which components, and the container is responsible
			for hooking it all together. The container creates all the objects, wires
			them together by setting the necessary properties, and determines when
			methods are invoked.</p>
		<p>More recently, this concept has been renamed <a
			href="http://www.martinfowler.com/articles/injection.html">Dependency
			Injection</a>.</p>
		<p>There are three different implementation pattern types for IoC:</p>
		<table>
			<tr>
				<td>type-1</td>
				<td>Services need to implement a dedicated interface through which they
					are provided with an object from which they can look up dependencies
					(other services). This is the pattern used by the earlier containers
					provided by Excalibur.</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>type-2</td>
				<td>Service dependencies are assigned via JavaBeans properties
					(setter methods). Both Gaderian and  <a href="spring">Spring</a>
					 use this approach.</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>type-3</td>
				<td>Services dependencies are provided as constructor parameters (and
					are not exposed as JavaBeans properties). This is the exclusive
					approach used by <a href="http://www.picocontainer.org/">
					PicoContainer</a>, and is also used in Gaderian and Spring.</td>
			</tr>
		</table>
		<p>Gaderian is a much looser system than Excalibur. Gaderian doesn't have an
			explicit assembly stage; it wires together all the modules it can find at
			runtime. Gaderian is responsible for creating services (including core
			implementations and interceptors). It is quite possible to create service
			factories that do very container-like things, including connecting
			services together. <a href="gaderian/BuilderFactory.html">gaderian.BuilderFactory</a> does just that, instantiating
			an object to act as the core service implementation, then setting
			properties of the object, some of which are references to services and
			configuration point element data.</p>
		<p>In Gaderian, you are free to mix and match type-2 (property injection)
			and type-3 (constructor injection), setting some (or all) dependencies via
			a constructor and some (or all) via JavaBeans properties.</p>
		<p>In addition, JavaBeans properties (for dependencies) can be write-only.
			You only need to provide a setter method. The properties are properties of
			the core service implementation, there is no need for the accessor methods
			to be part of the service interface.</p>
		<p>Gaderian's lifecycle support is much more rudimentary than Excalibur's. Your
			service implementations can get Gaderian callbacks when they are first
			created, and when they are discarded, by implementing certain interfaces.</p>
		<p>Purist inversion of control, as in Excalibur, may be more appropriate in
			well-constrained systems containing untrusted code. Gaderian is a layer
			below that, not an application server, but a microkernel. Although I can
			see using Gaderian as the infrastructure of an application server, even an
			Excalibur application server, it doesn't directly overlap otherwise.</p>

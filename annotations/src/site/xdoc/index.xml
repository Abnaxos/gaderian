        <section name="Gaderian Annotations">

            <p>The Gaderian Annotations module provides various Java annotations that, when used on your own classes,
                allow for control over how a service is instantiated and used.
            </p>

            <p>
                The annotations defined do not depend on any other Gaderian modules, allowing simple, direct usage of
                the annotations without dragging in any additional dependencies. 
            </p>

            <p>Please not that the usage of annotations are only applicable under certain circumstances and depend on the
                service factory used.  The annotation in question will describe the context in which it applies.</p>


            <p>Currently, the annotations provided with Gaderian fall into the following main categories:</p>
            <ul>
<!--
                <li>
                    <a href="lifecycle.html">Lifecycle</a>: Defines lifecycle callback method annotations.
                </li>
-->
                <li>
                    <a href="validation.html">Validation</a>: Defines various validation rules to use when validating an instantiated service
                </li>
<!--
                <li>
                    <a href="registry.html">Registry Creation</a>: Defines annotations for constructing a registry using Java
                </li>
                <li>
                    <a href="miscellaneous.html">Miscellaneous</a>: All other annotations
                </li>

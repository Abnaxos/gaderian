        <section name="Gaderian Lifecycle Annotations ">

            <p>The lifecycle annotation is used to control what callbacks your service implementation should be receiving from Gaderian.
                A method is annotated with the <i>LifecycleEventCallback</i> annotation, specifying the list of lifecycle events that the method handles.</p>

            <p>The complete set of lifecycle events maintained by Gaderian are listed below:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Initialize</li>
                <li>Activate</li>
                <li>Invocation Complete</li>
                <li>Passivate</li>
                <li>Shutdown Signalled</li>
                <li>Shutdown</li>
            </ul>

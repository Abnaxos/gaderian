        <section name="Validation Annotations">

            <p>The validation annotations are used to validate various aspects of service creation and instantiation.  They
            are an extension to the XML descriptors used to configure services in Gaderian.</p>

            <p>The complete set of validation annotations are listed below:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>@validate</li>
            </ul>

            <subsection name="@Validate">

                <p>
                    <strong>Usage:</strong> Field<br/>
                    <strong>Context:</strong> BuilderFactory<br/>
                </p>

                <p>The <code>@validate</code> annotation is used to annotate that a particular field of a service implemention
                    must be assigned as part of autowiring the instance. If the annotation is present, Gaderian will check
                    to ensure that this is the case and if not, throw an appropriate error.</p>


                <p>For example, in the below code sample, the _foo service field has been marked as required.</p>

                <source>  ...

  @Validate
  private Foo _foo;

  public void setFoo(final Foo foo)
  {
    _foo = foo;
  }

  ...</source>

            </subsection>
